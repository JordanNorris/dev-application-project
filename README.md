# Dev Application Project

Developer "test" for recruitment at Zest The Agency

Use this repo to complete the tasks defined below, and submit your work via Pull Request.

## Task 1: Build HTML component

The purpose of this task is for you to demonstrate your knowledge of HTML & CSS, showing an understanding of modern code standards and techniques.

Given the file `task-1/index.html`, You are required to build the HTML component to the design shown in `task-1/design.png`.
Your solution should match the design as closely as possible and, although you haven't been provided with a mobile design, you will be awarded _"bonus marks"_ for responsiveness.

###### Note: we haven't included the thumbnail images shown in the design, so you can either use an image of your choosing, or add a fallback background colour.

## Task 2: Diagnose and fix PHP bug in existing WordPress application

For this task, we have provided an existing WordPress install. Imagine this is a client's website, and the client has reported a bug:

> In the list of users, everyone is called Bob!

You are required to find the relevant code block, starting from `index.php` in the `twentytwentyone` theme, diagnose the problem given the client's raised issue, and write a fix.

###### Note: We have included all the files necessary to set up a local working environment. This will require a local mySQL database, and you will need to import the data contained in the `task-2/wp_dev_application.sql` file
